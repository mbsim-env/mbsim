\section{\MBSim - Program Overview}
\MBSim{} is written in the object-oriented programming language C++. The interface of all classes is documented in the source code using Doxygen. This documentation has been extracted for convenient study together with a class overview during installation with the command \texttt{make doc}. Just change to \texttt{\$HOME/MBSim/*/doc/html} and open \texttt{index.html} with an appropriate browser. With this class documentation and the use of self-explaining names in the user interface it is goal of this section to give an overview about the main features of \MBSim{}.\par
\MBSim{} can handle a set of dynamical systems from various domains not only separated but also exchanging data of the form
\begin{align*}
\dot{\vq}&=\vT\vu\\
\vM\dot{\vu}&=\vh\left(\vq,\vu,t\right)+\vW\vlambda\\
\dot{\vx}&=\vf\left(\vx\right)\\
&\mathcal{\vN}\left(\vq,\vu,t\right)
\end{align*}
A typical example of a dynamical system only from mechanics is given by Fig.~\ref{fig:objects}.

\end{figure}
One has the environment and two objects, in mechanics called bodies, holding the inertia terms. Indicated are interconnecting links due to contacts between body contours giving also the possibility to model friction and ideal joints between body frames as well as an external kinetic excitation acting on a body frame. These ingredients from the mechanical point of view and a schedule of the simulation are basically explained in the following to have an easier begin with \MBSim{}.

\subsection{Description of the Components}
The following classes can be used for modelling and simulating dynamical systems in \MBSim{}.

\subsubsection{DynamicSystem and DynamicSystemSolver}
Hierarchically objects and links belong to \texttt{DynamicSystem}s, which themselves can be grouped. The top-most \texttt{DynamicSystem} is called \texttt{DynamicSystemSolver}. It also represents the interface to the integration schemes and allows the setting of environment variables (e.g. gravitation).\par

\item[] \texttt{setStopIfNoConvergence}\\
    the integrator stops integration, if there is no convergence in the contact solver
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Frames}
\texttt{Frame}s are a basic concept in \MBSim{} to define an interface for \MBSim{} components concerning kinematic and kinetic expressions. New \texttt{frame}s can be added arbitrarily and recursively based on a predecessor frame. That is why there has to be a first frame for specific \MBSim{} components, e.g. each \texttt{DynamicSystem} has got a stationary frame \texttt{"I"} (inertia frame).\par
Important settings next to position and Cartesian orientation are defined according to the parametrisation
\begin{align*}
  	\begin{pmatrix}	\rs{_I}[_P]{\va}\\ \rs{_I}{\vPsi}\end{pmatrix} 
	&= \begin{pmatrix}\rs{_I}[_P]{\vJ}\\ \rs{_I}[_R]{\vJ}\end{pmatrix} \,
	\dot{\vu} +
   	  \begin{pmatrix}\rs{_I}[_P]{\viota}\\\rs{_I}[_R]{\viota}\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
such that summarizing

    add a \texttt{Contour}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Rigid Bodies}
For each \texttt{RigidBody} a \texttt{Frame} \texttt{"C"} in the centre of gravity is predefined. One perhaps newly created \texttt{Frame} of the \texttt{RigidBody} has to be chosen as frame for kinematics, and one \texttt{Frame} of another \texttt{Body} or a \texttt{DynamicSystem} has to be chosen as frame of reference. Then, the motion of the frame of kinematics and so also the \texttt{RigidBody} with respect to this frame of reference is defined by the individual generalised coordinates of the \texttt{RigidBody} or its constrained relative motion. Both absolute (if the frame of reference belongs to a \texttt{DynamicSystem}) and relative (if the frame of reference belongs to another \texttt{RigidBody}) kinematical structures are canonically given by this frame recursion. The drawback of this general description is a time-dependent mass-matrix also in the absolute kinematics case.\par
Important settings: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \texttt{setMass}
\item[] \texttt{setInertiaTensor}\\
    is defined with respect to \texttt{"C"}, if no other \texttt{Frame} is given as second argument

\item[] \texttt{setOpenMBVRigidBody}\\

\end{itemize}
Kinematics can be defined individually according to
\begin{align*}
        \rs{_B}[_{O'P}]{\vr} &= \rs{_B}[_{O'P}]{\vr}({\vq}_{\text{rel}}^{(i)},\,t)\,,\\
        \vA_{BK} &= \vA_{BK}({\vq}_{\text{rel}}^{(i)},\,t)\,,\\
        \rs{_B}[_{O'P,\text{rel}}]{\vv} &=  \rs{_B}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \,\vu_\text{rel}^{(i)} + \rs{_B}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\viota}  \, \\
        \rs{_B}[_{BK}]{\vomega} &= \rs{_B}[_{R,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \,\vu_\text{rel}^{(i)} + \rs{_B}[_{R,\text{rel}}]{\viota} \\
        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_B}[_{O'P,\text{rel}}]{\vv}\right) &= \rs{_I}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \,\dot{\vu}_\text{rel}^{(i)} +\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_B}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \right)\,\vu_\text{rel}^{(i)} + \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_B}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\viota} \right)  \,,\\ 
        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_B}[_{BK}]{\vomega}\right) &= \rs{_I}[_{R,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \,\dot{\vu}_\text{rel}^{(i)} +\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_B}[_{R,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \right)\,\vu_\text{rel}^{(i)} + \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_B}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\viota} \right)  \,. 
\end{align*}
using the member functions
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \texttt{setTranslation}
\item[] \texttt{setRotation}
\item[] \texttt{setJacobianOfTranslation}
\item[] \texttt{setJacobianOfRotation}
\item[] \texttt{setDerivativeOfJacobianOfTranslation}

\item[] \texttt{setGuidingVelocityOfRotation}

For convenience it is sometimes not necessary to define all components. E.g. for a \texttt{LinearTranslation} as well as \texttt{RotationAboutFixedAxis} and \texttt{CardanAngles} everything else is derived automatically.

\paragraph{Flexible Bodies}
The equations of motion of a \texttt{FlexibleBody} is at the moment only available with respect to a stationary frame. So, for flexible bodies the frame of reference must belong to a \texttt{DynamicSystem}. The following flexible bodies are available.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Functions}

\subsection{Program Flow}
Conceptionally the program flow is defined by the election of the integration scheme. It can always be stopped using \texttt{Ctrl-C} also enforcing the closing of the plot functionality. With
\begin{verbatim}
kill -USR2 <PID of simulation thread>
\end{verbatim}
a flush of the plot routine is asked for.

\subsection{Plot Routines}\label{sec:plot}

\subsubsection{Usage}
The result of a simulation with \MBSim{} are a \texttt{mbsim.h5} file for plot analysis as well as \texttt{ombv.h5} and \texttt{ombv.xml} files for visualisation. Additionally there is information concerning the integrator in \texttt{*.plt} and \texttt{*.sum} files; for visualisation \texttt{*.iv} files might appear.\\
For getting data from \MBSim{} a \HDF{} wrapper is used. Plotting the multibody system data can be done with
\begin{verbatim}
    h5plotserie <h5-file>
\end{verbatim}
The usage is quite canonic and documented in the online help. Interesting features are
\begin{itemize}
\item superimposing graphs by \texttt{<shift>}
\item plotting labels by \texttt{<ctrl>}
\item disabling graphs by double click
\end{itemize}
With
\begin{verbatim}
    h5lsserie <h5-file>
\end{verbatim}
basically the content can be shown. Several possible options are explained by typing \texttt{-h}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\texttt{-d}] shows the description of the data to plot
\item[\texttt{-l}] shows the column labels of the data to plot
\item[\texttt{-f}] follows external links in a set of \HDF{}-files to avoid redundant data (\HDF{} is possible per DynamicSystem)
\end{enumerate}
The specific names in \HDF{} format are specialised by reading from right to left. The url to specific data is given by a path and can be used in
\begin{verbatim}
    h5dumpserie <path>
\end{verbatim}
perhaps also in other tools. The column one is interested in is declared using a colon. Also several columns can be appended, whereby shorter ones are enlarged by \texttt{nan} entries. Altogether, it is possible to use the dump by
\begin{verbatim}
    gnuplot "<dump" u *:* w l
\end{verbatim}
or in \textsf{MatLab} by
\begin{verbatim}
    h5dump('<path>')
\end{verbatim}
\OpenMBV{} files can be openen by just typing \texttt{openmbv} in the specific directory. The usage should be quite canonic and is explained in the online help.


\subsubsection{Implementation}
In \MBSim{} plotting is done using \texttt{plotFeatures} being defined in \texttt{element.h}. They are set in \texttt{dynamic\_system\_solver.cc}. One plot-file comprises time-series of rowvectors with the same data type in all entries.
