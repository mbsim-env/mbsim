\section{\MBSim - Program Overview}
From the software development point of view, \cite{Sch97} proposed a standard structure for multibody simulation frameworks distinguishing between bodies and interactions. Also the programs described in \cite{Aca07} and \cite{Ber07} follow this approach. It is approved and also used in \MBSim{} using the object-oriented C++ programming style. The interface of all classes is documented in the source code using Doxygen. This documentation has been extracted for convenient study together with a class overview during installation with the command \texttt{make doc}. Just change to \texttt{\$HOME/MBSim/*/doc/html} and open \texttt{index.html} with an appropriate browser. With this class documentation and the use of self-explaining names in the user interface it is goal of this section to give an overview about the main features of \MBSim{}.\par

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Figure~\ref{fig:departure:mbsim:embedding} shows the embedding of \MBSim{} in the global simulation and analysing process.

\MBSim{} can handle a set of dynamical systems from various domains not only separated but also exchanging data of the form
\begin{align*}
\dot{\vq}&=\vY\vu\,,\\
\vM\dot{\vu}&=\vh\left(\vq,\vu,t\right)+\vW\vlambda\,,\\
\dot{\vx}&=\vf\left(\vx\right)\,,\\
&\left(\vq,\vu,\vlambda,t\right)\in\mathcal{N}\,.
\end{align*}
Though, the simulation of hydraulics, electronics, control and power train systems is included within several modules. \MBSim{} is based on the interface \FMatVec{} using either LaPack\footnote{cf.~\url{http://www.netlib.org/lapack/}} or ATLAS\footnote{cf.~\url{http://www.netlib.org/atlas/}} for fast evaluation of linear algebra routines. Further, it uses \emph{HDF5Serie} to write files using the hierarchical HDF5 file format\footnote{cf.~\url{http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/}} even for large dynamical systems. These files can be read by \emph{H5PlotSerie} for plotting or by \OpenMBV{} for visualisation. Thereby, \OpenMBV{} is based on the Coin implementation\footnote{cf.~\url{http://www.coin3d.org/}} of the Open Inventor Library\footnote{\url{http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/}}. Also a co-simulation with Matlab/Simulink\footnote{cf.~\url{http://www.mathworks.de/}}, HySim \cite{Bor03} for hydraulic components and KetSim \cite{Fri98} for camshaft timing chains is possible. \MBSim{} is divided in a modelling part using C++ or XML and a simulation part. The simulation part is implemented quite modular distinguishing between the update of bodies and interactions concerning kinematics, kinetics as well as force laws and integration / nonlinear solution schemes. Also here external libraries are used where it is possible for having always a state-of-the-art numerical basis.
A typical example of a dynamical system only from mechanics is given by Figure~\ref{fig:objects}.

\end{figure}
One has the environment and two \texttt{Object}s, in mechanics called \texttt{Body}s, holding the inertia terms. Indicated are interconnecting \texttt{Link}s due to \texttt{Contact}s between \texttt{Body} \texttt{Contour}s giving also the possibility to model friction and ideal \texttt{Joint}s between body \texttt{Frame}s as well as an external \texttt{KineticExcitation} acting on a body \texttt{Frame}. These ingredients from the mechanical point of view and a schedule of the simulation are basically explained in the following to have an easier begin with \MBSim{}.

\subsection{Description of the Components}
The following classes can be used for modelling and simulating dynamical systems in \MBSim{}.

\subsubsection{DynamicSystem and DynamicSystemSolver}
Hierarchically objects and links belong to \texttt{DynamicSystem}s, which themselves can be \texttt{Group}ed (cf.~Figure~\ref{fig:departure:mbsim:dynamicsystem}). 
\begin{figure}[hbt]%
	\centering
    \footnotesize
  	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/mbsim_dynamicsystem.eps} 
  	\caption{Dynamic system type classes in \MBSim{}}
  	\label{fig:departure:mbsim:dynamicsystem}
\end{figure}
Shaded one can see interfaces for the different components of the modelling equations
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ExtraDynamicInterface} 
  \begin{align}
  \dot{\vx}=\vf\left(\vx\right)
  \end{align}
\item \texttt{ObjectInterface}
  \begin{align}
  \dot{\vq}&=\vY\vu\,,\\
  \vM\left(\vq\right)\dot{\vu}&=\vh\left(\vq,\vu,t\right)\,,\,\vM\,\text{symmetric positive definite}
  \end{align}
\item \texttt{LinkInterface}
  \begin{align}
  &\left(\vq,\vu,\vlambda,t\right)\in\mathcal{N}\,,\\
  &\vh\left(\vq,\vu,t\right)\,,\vW\left(\vq\right)\vlambda
 \end{align} 
\end{itemize}
and \texttt{Element} for load/save mechanism as well as plot and data administration. Class \texttt{Tree} is dotted as it is not available for modelling. A tree structure is automatically built during initialisation for an efficient simulation process evaluating the hierarchical modelling structure. The top-most \texttt{DynamicSystem} is called \texttt{DynamicSystemSolver}. It also represents the interface to the integration schemes and allows the setting of environment variables (e.g. gravitation).\par

\item[] \texttt{setStopIfNoConvergence}\\

\end{itemize}
%
\subsubsection{Frames}
\texttt{Frame}s are a basic concept in the kernel of \MBSim{} to define an interface for \MBSim{} multibody components concerning kinematic and kinetic expressions. New \texttt{Frame}s can be added arbitrarily and recursively based on a predecessor \texttt{Frame}. That is why there has to be a first \texttt{Frame} for specific \MBSim{} components, e.g. each \texttt{DynamicSystem} has got a stationary \texttt{Frame} \texttt{"I"} (inertia frame).\par
Important settings next to position and Cartesian orientation are defined according to the parametrisation
\begin{align*}
  	\begin{pmatrix}	\rs{_I}[_P]{\va}\\ \rs{_I}{\vPsi}\end{pmatrix} 
	&= \begin{pmatrix}\rs{_I}[_P]{\vJ}\\ \rs{_I}[_R]{\vJ}\end{pmatrix} \,
	\dot{\vu} +
   	  \begin{pmatrix}\rs{_I}[_P]{\viota}\\\rs{_I}[_R]{\viota}\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
of translational and angular acceleration. This is basically an affine relationship concerning the derivative of generalised velocities $\dot{\vu}$, appropriate \textsc{Jacobian} matrices and an explicit time dependent summand.

\item[] \texttt{getGyroscopicAccelerationOfRotation}
\item[] \texttt{enableOpenMBV}\\

\end{itemize}
are important settings.
%
\subsubsection{Bodies}
Mechanical \texttt{Body}s provide their portion of a positive definite mass matrix, a smooth right hand side, a state and energy expressions according to \texttt{Object}, which is e.g. similar to some hydraulic objects (cf.~Figure~\ref{fig:departure:mbsim:object}).
\begin{figure}[hbt]%
	\centering
    \footnotesize
  	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Figures/mbsim_object.eps} 
  	\caption{Object type classes in \MBSim{}}
  	\label{fig:departure:mbsim:object}
\end{figure}
Different is the kinematic description which is based on \texttt{Frame}s in the case of mechanical \texttt{Body}s. Also the connectors to other \texttt{Body}s might follow other structural rules. Depending on the type of linkage \texttt{Frame}s or \texttt{Contour}s occur in the case of \texttt{Body}s.\par
Important settings: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \texttt{addFrame}\\
    add a \texttt{Frame}
\item[] \texttt{addContour}\\
    add a \texttt{Contour}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Rigid Bodies}
For each \texttt{RigidBody} a \texttt{Frame} \texttt{"C"} in the centre of gravity is predefined. One perhaps newly created \texttt{Frame} of the \texttt{RigidBody} has to be chosen as frame for kinematics \texttt{"K"} with centre $P$ and one \texttt{Frame} of another \texttt{Body} or a \texttt{DynamicSystem} has to be chosen as frame of reference \texttt{"R"} with centre $O'$. Both absolute --if the frame of reference belongs to a \texttt{DynamicSystem}-- and relative --if the frame of reference belongs to another \texttt{RigidBody}-- kinematic structures are canonically given by the frame recursion. The motion of the frame of kinematics and so also the \texttt{RigidBody} with respect to the frame of reference is defined by the individual generalised coordinates ${\vq}_{\text{rel}}$ of the \texttt{RigidBody} or its constrained relative motion. These settings can be defined individually on position, velocity and acceleration level according to
\begin{align}
        \rs{_R}[_{O'P}]{\vr} &= \rs{_R}[_{O'P}]{\vr}({\vq}_{\text{rel}},\,t)\,,\\
        \vA_{RK} &= \vA_{RK}({\vq}_{\text{rel}},\,t)\,,\\
        \rs{_R}[_{O'P,\text{rel}}]{\vv} &=  \rs{_R}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \,\vu_\text{rel} + \rs{_R}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\viota}  \, \\
        \rs{_R}[_{RK}]{\vomega} &= \rs{_R}[_{R,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \,\vu_\text{rel} + \rs{_R}[_{R,\text{rel}}]{\viota} \\
        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_R}[_{O'P,\text{rel}}]{\vv}\right) &= \rs{_I}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \,\dot{\vu}_\text{rel} +\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_R}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \right)\,\vu_\text{rel} + \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_R}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\viota} \right)  \,,\\ 
        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_R}[_{RK}]{\vomega}\right) &= \rs{_I}[_{R,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \,\dot{\vu}_\text{rel} +\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_R}[_{R,\text{rel}}]{\vJ} \right)\,\vu_\text{rel} + \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t}\left(\rs{_R}[_{P,\text{rel}}]{\viota} \right)
\end{align}
and Figure~\ref{fig:departure:mbsim:rigid_kinematics} also including the link relationships of frames and contours.
\begin{figure}[hbt]%

  	\caption{Rigid kinematics in \MBSim{}}
  	\label{fig:departure:mbsim:rigid_kinematics}
\end{figure}
The drawback of this general description is a time-dependent mass-matrix also in the absolute kinematics case.\par
Important settings: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \texttt{setMass}
\item[] \texttt{setInertiaTensor}\\
    is defined with respect to \texttt{"C"}, if no other \texttt{Frame} is given as second argument
\item[] \texttt{setFrameOfReference}\\
    one possibility to define initial values
\item[] \texttt{setFrameForKinematics}
\item[] \texttt{setOpenMBVRigidBody}\\
    enabling visualisation for \OpenMBV{}
\end{itemize}
Kinematics can be defined individually using the member functions
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \texttt{setTranslation}
\item[] \texttt{setRotation}
\item[] \texttt{setJacobianOfTranslation}
\item[] \texttt{setJacobianOfRotation}
\item[] \texttt{setDerivativeOfJacobianOfTranslation}
\item[] \texttt{setDerivativeOfJacobianOfRotation}
\item[] \texttt{setGuidingVelocityOfTranslation}
\item[] \texttt{setGuidingVelocityOfRotation}
\item[] \texttt{setDerivativeOfGuidingVelocityOfTranslation}
\item[] \texttt{setDerivativeOfGuidingVelocityOfRotation}
\end{itemize}
For convenience it is sometimes not necessary to define all components. E.g. for a \texttt{LinearTranslation} as well as \texttt{RotationAboutFixedAxis} and \texttt{CardanAngles} everything else is derived automatically.

\paragraph{Flexible Bodies}
The equations of motion of a \texttt{FlexibleBody} is at the moment only available with respect to a stationary \texttt{Frame}. So, for flexible bodies the frame of reference must belong to a \texttt{DynamicSystem}. The following flexible bodies are available. 

\begin{itemize}

%\item \emph{BodyFlexible1s21ANCF} 2D-Balken mit Absolute Nodal Coordinate Formulation
\item[] \texttt{FlexibleBody1s21RCM}\\

\item[] \texttt{FlexibleBody1s33RCM}\\
  spatial beam using redundant coordinate methode with six coordinates per finite element node, translation  $x$, $y$, $z$ and reversed Cardan rotation $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, as well as four additional bending deflections $c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$, $c_4$
%\item \emph{BodyFlexible1s23BTA} Biege-Torsions-Welle (5-Koordinaten pro Knoten $\alpha$, $y$, $\gamma$, $z$, $\beta$ im jeweils mit $\alpha$ mitdrehenden KOSY)
%\item \emph{BodyFlexibleLinearExternal}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{LinkMechanics}

  	\caption{Link type classes in \MBSim{}}
  	\label{fig:departure:mbsim:link}
\end{figure}
If other connectors are used other link classes have to be inherited. Always \texttt{Link}s distribute locally to $\vh$ and $\vW\vlambda$ in the equations of motion.\par

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Joints}
\texttt{Joint}s connect two \texttt{Frame}s with the force laws depending on the ideal normal relative kinematics. The constitutive law has to be chosen for the calculation of the force parameter.\par

\item accompanying contour trihedral\\
    the first column is the outward pointing normal, then the two tangentials follow with only the first tangent-pair having opposite sign 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Functions}
Depending on the number of arguments it is possible to derive new functions from \texttt{Function1}, \texttt{Function2} and \texttt{Function3} by specifying the template parameters. They are used at various places and are a general way of re-using functional descriptions.

\subsubsection{Integration Schemes}
Available integration schemes:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \texttt{DOPRI5Integrator}\\

\subsection{Program Flow}
Conceptionally the program flow is defined by the election of the integration scheme. It can always be stopped using \texttt{Ctrl-C} also enforcing the closing of the plot functionality. With
\begin{verbatim}
kill -USR2 <PID of simulation thread>
\end{verbatim}
a flush of the plot routine is asked for.

\subsubsection{Timestepping Integration}
Timestepping integration solves the whole equations of the system including the contacts on velocity level with fixed time step size. In detail one has the following work flow.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\text{\texttt{DS::plot}}\left(t,\vq,\vu\right)$
\item $\vq\leftarrow\vq+\text{\texttt{DS::deltaq}}\left(t,\vq,\vu\right)$
\item $t\leftarrow t+\Delta t$
\item $\text{\texttt{DS::update}}\left(t,\vq,\vu\right)$
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[]\texttt{DS::updateStateDependentVariables}\\
      update variables depending on the generalised state and the structure of the system with one independent group and several recursive calculation trees
    \item[]\texttt{DS::updateg}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item update of the relative position kinematics independent of the system structure using the order
      \begin{align*}
        \text{\texttt{Link}}\rightarrow\text{\texttt{LinkMechanics}}\left(\rightarrow\text{\texttt{ContactKinematics}}\right)
      \end{align*}
      \item several contacts points are possible from the kinematical point of view, whereby the maximum number is calculated in \texttt{ContactKinematics}\\
      \end{itemize}
    \item[]\texttt{DS::checkActiveg}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item determine the state of the relative kinematics concerning the activity of links
      \item redefine global memory references using indices 
      \end{itemize}
    \item[]\texttt{DS::updategd}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item update of the relative velocity kinematics independent of the system structure
      \item can be done in the child classes of \texttt{LinkMechanics}
      \end{itemize}
    \item[]\texttt{DS::updateT}\\

    \item[]\texttt{updateM}\\
      updates the mass matrix independent of the system structure
    \item[]\texttt{facLLM}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item computes the \textsc{Cholesky} decomposition of the mass matrix dependent on the system structure
      \item \texttt{group} calculates the matrix inverse locally per object
      \item \texttt{tree} calculates the matrix inverse globally
      \end{itemize}
    \item[]\texttt{updateW}\\
      updates the \textsc{Jacobian} between in general set-valued \texttt{link}-force parameters and generalised coordinates
    \item[]\texttt{updateV}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item the decomposition of the in general set-valued \texttt{link}-forces
      \begin{align*}
      \vW\vlambda=\vW_N\vlambda_N+\vW_T\vlambda_T
      \end{align*}
      in a normal and tangential part allows to separate the single-valued slip case
      \item for affected \texttt{links} it is
      \begin{align*}
      \tilde{\vW}\tilde{\vlambda}=\left(\tilde{\vW}_N+\mu\tilde{\vW}_T\right)\tilde{\vlambda}_N=\tilde{\vV}\tilde{\vlambda}_N\ .
      \end{align*}
      \item altogether this is a reduction of the set-valued equations being expressed by the projection
      \begin{align*}
      \vV\vlambda^{*}\ .
      \end{align*}
      \end{itemize}
    \item[]\texttt{updateG}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item the force action matrix
      \begin{align*}
      \vG=\vW^T\vM^{-1}\vV
      \end{align*}
      must be calculated by the most global view, namely the \texttt{DynamicSystemSolver}
      \item the size of $\vG$ is reduced due to the introduction of $\vV$ but is non-symmetric

\item $\vu\leftarrow\vu+\text{\texttt{DS::deltau}}$
\item $\vx\leftarrow\vx+\text{\texttt{DS::deltax}}$
\item \texttt{DS::projectGeneralizedPositions}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Event-Driven Integration}
Currently, \texttt{LSODAR} is the only event-driven integrator with automatic switch between stiff and non-stiff equations.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{DS::computeInitialCondition}\\
    checks for system configuration and creates the necessary contact container
\item $\text{\texttt{DS::plot}}\left(t,\vq\right)$
\item \texttt{DLSODAR} 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[]$\text{\texttt{DS::zdot}}\left(t,\vq,\vu\right)$ is available for standard and inverse kinetics calculations
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{wb} means $\bar{w}$ and describes the acceleration terms in the constraint kinematics
      \item \texttt{computeConstraintForces} uses a least square algorithm to solve the Delassus equations, assume $Ax=b$ with a $m\times n$ full-rank matrix $A$, then there are two cases
        \begin{itemize}
        \item $m\geq n$ (skinny) can always be solved by $\left\|Ax-b\right\|\rightarrow\min$ and so by SVD\\
          analytically the solution is given by the normal equations $x=\left(A^TA\right)^{-1}A^Tb$
        \item $m<n$ (fat) has an infinite dimensional solution space, one has to pick one solution\\
          $\left\|x\right\|\rightarrow\min,\ Ax=b$ which is analytically given by $x=A^T\left(A^TA\right)^{-1}b$, again numerically a SVD solves the problem most efficiently
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \item[]\texttt{DS::getsv} the stop vector defines the root function concerning contacts and stick-slip-transitions for the DAE solver
      \begin{itemize}
      \item it can be only set by \texttt{Link}
      \item contains kinematics for not-active directions and kinetics for active directions
      \item the last entry is used for position and velocity projections
      \item is solved by integrator concerning a tolerance
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\item \texttt{DS::shift} is invoked, if there is a sign change in the stop vector
    \begin{itemize}
      \item drift compensation if indicated by stop vector
      \item project to slighly positive gaps to avoid instantaneous appearance of new shift point
      \item \texttt{updateCondition} should impact or differential equations be solved, after earlier mentioned reconfiguring?
      \item case studies
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[] \texttt{impact} has highest priority and changes overall configuration
        \item[] \texttt{impact} requires \texttt{D::checkAllgd} because of possible slip-stick transition
        \item no difference between $\Lambda$ and $\lambda$
        \item \texttt{gdn} means $\dot{g}^{+}$
        \item[] \texttt{impact} involves new configuration and so also the equations of motion have to be solved
        \item \texttt{checkActivegdd} has to be done with the same tolerance like in the nonlinear equations solver
        \item[] \texttt{gActive} means a contact is closed
        \item[] \texttt{gdActive} means a contact remains closed
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Plot Routines}\label{sec:plot}

\subsubsection{Usage}
The result of a simulation with \MBSim{} are a \texttt{mbsim.h5} file for plot analysis as well as \texttt{ombv.h5} and \texttt{ombv.xml} files for visualisation. Additionally there is information concerning the integrator in \texttt{*.plt} and \texttt{*.sum} files; for visualisation \texttt{*.iv} files might appear.\\
For getting data from \MBSim{} a \HDF{} wrapper is used. Plotting the multibody system data can be done with
\begin{verbatim}
    h5plotserie <h5-file>
\end{verbatim}
The usage is quite canonic and documented in the online help. Interesting features are
\begin{itemize}
\item superimposing graphs by \texttt{<shift>}
\item plotting labels by \texttt{<ctrl>}
\item disabling graphs by double click
\end{itemize}
With
\begin{verbatim}
    h5lsserie <h5-file>
\end{verbatim}
basically the content can be shown. Several possible options are explained by typing \texttt{-h}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\texttt{-d}] shows the description of the data to plot
\item[\texttt{-l}] shows the column labels of the data to plot
\item[\texttt{-f}] follows external links in a set of \HDF{}-files to avoid redundant data (\HDF{} is possible per DynamicSystem)
\end{enumerate}
The specific names in \HDF{} format are specialised by reading from right to left. The url to specific data is given by a path and can be used in
\begin{verbatim}
    h5dumpserie <path>
\end{verbatim}
perhaps also in other tools. The column one is interested in is declared using a colon. Also several columns can be appended, whereby shorter ones are enlarged by \texttt{nan} entries. Altogether, it is possible to use the dump by
\begin{verbatim}
    gnuplot "<dump" u *:* w l
\end{verbatim}
or in \textsf{MatLab} by
\begin{verbatim}
    h5dump('<path>')
\end{verbatim}
\OpenMBV{} files can be openen by just typing \texttt{openmbv} in the specific directory. The usage should be quite canonic and is explained in the online help.


\subsubsection{Implementation}
In \MBSim{} plotting is done using \texttt{plotFeatures} being defined in \texttt{element.h}. They are set in \texttt{dynamic\_system\_solver.cc}. One plot-file comprises time-series of rowvectors with the same data type in all entries.
